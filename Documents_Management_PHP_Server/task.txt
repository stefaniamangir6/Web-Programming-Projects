Write a web application for managing documents. 
The application should maintain various information about a document in the database (i.e. author, title, number of pages, type, format etc.). 
The application should implement: document browsing (use AJAX for retrieving documents of a specific type or format), adding, removing and updating a document. 
Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. type or format), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
